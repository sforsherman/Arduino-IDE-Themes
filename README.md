# Arduino-IDE-Themes
This repository is the collection for different Arduino IDE related themes.


# Introduction
============================================================================
Hey guys, thanks for visiting this repo that I have created for collecting different Arduino IDE themes. I have just added the first theme, which is related to onlinelabseries, a non-profit online education & skills training learning platform/community that I founded just over 4 months ago.

If you like to contribute to this theme folder, do reach out to me and let me know. My email is sherman@thecxhacker.guru. You can also follow me and reach out to me via the following social media accounts:

- Twitter: @thecxhacker

## Available Themes:
============================================================================
1. OLS Arduino Theme
2. More to come

# Word of Advice
============================================================================
When working replace or override any existing program files, also make a backup copy before changing anything. This will ensure that if something goes wrong, you can always revert back to the original theme. Once you are sure that your theme works, you can replace the Arduino IDE's theme folder with what you have created.
